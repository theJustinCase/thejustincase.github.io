        <p>Canada, and great part of the United States. And I don't know any place I'd rather be this afternoon than
            where I am right now at Phoenix Arizona. And I come in the Name of the Lord to pray for the sick people, to
            say that I believe that many mighty miracles will be performed in these next eight Sundays. I trust it'll be
            one of the greatest meetings that will just give Phoenix an old fashion revival to start here, that it shall
            not end until the Master Himself shall appear on the scene.</p>
        <p>This morning when I woke up and got up from my bed, and went to the window, and raised back the curtains on
            the window, and looked back towards Camelback mountain, green palms between here and the mountain, and just
            as the sun was coming up and shining over the mountain, I thought how thankful that the people of Arizona,
            Phoenix, should be to live in such a place. They're closest towards heaven in Phoenix, Arizona. So such a
            heavenly atmosphere. I love it. And I'm thankful I've got these eight weeks to be with you, or eight
            Sundays.</p>

        <p>This Sunday, probably there's many here that I've never met before, and I want to meet you. I'd like to have
            a time with each one of you, to speak with you and shake your hand, and talk to you. Maybe I can later on.</p>
        <p>Soon as these services is over, I'm to go to--down in California right away, and then from there to Frisco,
            and then to Vancouver, British Columbia, to begin Tuesday. Expecting great crowds at Vancouver, because the
            Calgary meeting...</p>
        <p>That was my last service. The Lord Jesus came in the most powerful meeting that I've ever witnessed in all my
            life, at Calgary. It was powerful all through Canada. The Canadian people... Probably there's some of them
            here now. They will be after the service is over up there, 'cause there'll be hundreds that won't be able to
            get in the prayer line, will come on down here.</p>

    <div id="r109">
        <span class="paragraphLabel">E-3</span>
        <p>But the Canadian people are some thirty to fifty years behind America. They haven't got that fast life that
            we live now. They're never in no hurry. They're very humble and sweet people, waiting for the power of
            Almighty God. And He certainly did manifest His great fine power among the Canadian people. Deaf, dumb,
            blind, cancers, cripples, wheelchairs, oh, everything taken place. And there was many thousands who did not
            get into a prayer line, which are reported already gathered at Vancouver.</p>
        <p>One of the most outstanding things that I can think of at this time, was a little boy in a wheelchair, which
            I had made the statement, and it is true as I stand here... He promised me, this Angel, if I'd be sincere
            and would get the people to believe, there would be nothing stand before...</p>
        <p>Therefore, they wanted to see what would happen in a prayer line where there was nothing but cripples. And so
            they gave out that there'd be a prayer line, be a miracle line, for nothing but cripples. And we would get
            some of the people, see what would take place by the gift of healing. Which it is not a gift of miracles;
            it's the gift of healing. They wanted to see what would take place in a--a line of that type.</p>

        <p>There was a young man in his thirties, that had followed the meetings from--all the way from Saskatoon down
            to Edmonton, so forth, and on down into Calgary. He'd run out of funds. His mother had sold some of her
            possessions, and there was nothing left then for him to--to thrive on, just enough money to return home. And
            when she heard there was going to be a miracle line just for the crippled, then she pawned her wedding ring
            to get the boy to stay for the miracle line. That come into my ears that the mother had pawned her wedding
            ring to keep the boy there.</p>
        <p>That mother's wedding ring meant just as much to her as my mother's does, or my wife's, or your wife's. Means
            much to her. Maybe her husband might've been dead, for all I know. Well, we managed some way to see that she
            got repaid for that, and her money back.</p>

        <p>But that night, my little brother brought into the line this boy. He was the most hideous crippled person
            that I've seen in many years. His arms was drawn down to his legs. He was a very, very much of a sight to
            look at. Just before me was a little... [Blank.spot.on.tape--Ed.]</p>
        <p>...Judgment of God, where I'll have to give an account for every word that I... Every word that I have spoke,
            I'll have to answer for it. But all of a sudden my hand, the one which the gift comes through, the
            vibrations, got real hot. And I... The little child was some eight, nine years old, maybe not that old. And
            I laid it upon her little thigh, and something just moved downward. And friends, God being my Judge, Who I
            stand before; the four inches lacking on the child's leg was perfect. She put this Bible on her head and
            walked up-and-down before the audience, just as perfect as anyone could walk, like that. She was healed,
            over a hour of prayer for her.</p>

    <div id="r157">
        <span class="paragraphLabel">E-51</span>
        <p>I want to know from amongst my audience in the meeting, how many that think that I'm doing that what is
            right? Here's what's been. It's been a fuss and a push to try to get to that front line, is that right? A
            fuss and push, everybody's trying...?... From this time, God being my Helper, I shall just keep the same
            line I'm bring up there now like I am, in order. Just stand and pray for the people, and they're supposed to
            believe me; and they got so they won't believe. Why women's come back here and told me, "I didn't even get
            prayed for," and they went right through the line; because there wasn't a miracle performed. Hundreds of
            letters pours into my secretary and say, "They didn't even pray for me, I went through the fast line."
            You're supposed to believe friends, and take God at His word.</p>
        <p>Now, will you pray for me this week and for next Sunday, we'll come forth and see the Lord heal His people.
            God bless you.</p>
